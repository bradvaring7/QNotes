            <h3>Still Seeing Pests</h3>
            <p><em>"I understand why you are looking to make these changes. I would feel the same way if I was paying for something that I didn't feel was working.

            <h2>3rd - Offer Solutions</h2>
            <p>Based on the diagnostic questions, offer appropriate solutions that address their specific concerns.</p>

            <h3>Key Guidelines for Solutions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Asking Open Ended Questions:</strong> Do not assume a situation one way or the other in your question.
                    <div style="font-style: italic; color: #555; margin-top: 0.3rem; padding-left: 1rem;">
                        For example, do not say: <strong><em>"When did the agent yell at you?"</em></strong><br>
                        Instead say: <strong><em>"When did this happen?"</em></strong>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Active Listening:</strong> Truly listen to understand, not just to respond</li>
                <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Record all details for follow-up and improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Follow Through:</strong> Ensure promised actions are completed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4th - Set Expectations</h2>
            <p>Clearly communicate what happens next and when the customer can expect resolution or follow-up.</p>

            <h3>Follow-up Actions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide specific timelines for resolution</li>
                <li>Schedule follow-up calls when appropriate</li>
                <li>Ensure customer has direct contact information</li>
                <li>Document all commitments made to the customer</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Emergency Escalation</h2>
            <p><strong>When to immediately escalate to supervisor:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer threatens legal action</li>
                <li>Safety concerns are mentioned</li>
                <li>Customer requests to speak to a manager</li>
                <li>Situation exceeds your authority level</li>
                <li>Customer becomes verbally abusive</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Remember: The goal is to turn a negative experience into a positive one while maintaining the customer relationship.</em></p>
