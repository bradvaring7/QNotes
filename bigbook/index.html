They are social insects living in colonies, foraging for food and sometimes causing infestations. Understanding their behavior helps identify entry points and nests, which is crucial for effective pest control. Different species may require specific treatment approaches. Regular inspections, targeted baits, and eliminating food sources are essential in managing ant infestations and addressing customer concerns.</p>

                        <p>Wasps are flying insects with a slender body and a narrow waist. They can become a significant concern for families when they build nests near homes or play areas. Their presence poses stinging risks, potentially causing painful reactions and allergic responses, leading to safety and health concerns for family members.</p>

While most spiders are harmless and beneficial, some species can cause concern for families. Venomous spiders, like the black widow or brown recluse, can pose health risks if their bites are not promptly treated, leading to anxiety and potential safety measures for families in infested areas.</p>

                        <p>Cicada killers are large solitary wasps that hunt cicadas to provision their underground nests. Female cicada killers paralyze cicadas with their venom, lay eggs on them, and the hatched larvae feed on the cicadas. While their size might cause concern, cicada killers are generally not aggressive towards humans. They can occasionally disrupt lawns and gardens with their burrows, but their impact on families is minimal.</p>
