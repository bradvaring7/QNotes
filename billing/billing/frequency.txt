BILLING FREQUENCY  
⬆️ BILLING | KB: Billing Frequency

== OVERVIEW ==
• Determines how and when customers are charged for service  
• Influences billing cadence, scheduling, and customer experience  
• Primary billing types: Monthly, After Each Completed Service, Paid in Full (deprecated)

== FREQUENCY TYPES ==
• Monthly Billing  
  - Customer charged same date each month  
  - Total annual cost split into monthly installments  
  - Most common option  
  - Once active, cannot convert to "After Each Completed Service"  
  - Set via: Subscriptions tab → “Next Billing”

• After Each Completed Service  
  - Charges issued only when pro marks service complete  
  - Risk: Accidental charge if service marked prematurely  
  - TL/Manager approval required for refunds or invoice application  
  - Set via: Billing tab → “Preferred Billing Date”

• Paid in Full  
  - ❌ No longer offers 5% discount as of May 2025  
  - Any discount must be built into signed price  
  - Do not offer manual discount for full prepayment

== INITIAL FEE LOGIC ==
• One-time onboarding charge after agreement or initial service  
• Visible in Subscriptions tab and first invoice  
• Triggers:  
  → Agreement signed  
  → Service completed

== $39 PRE-CHARGE (Inside Sales Only) ==
• Confirms valid payment method  
• Added as account credit toward initial invoice  
• Refundable if service is canceled  
• May be applied to future service for same customer

== BILLING DATE ADJUSTMENT ==
• Agents may change billing due date without escalation  
• Autopay charges on chosen date  
• Adjust in:  
  - Monthly Billing → Subscriptions tab → “Next Billing”  
  - After Each Completed Service → Billing tab → “Preferred Billing Date”

== AGENT REMINDERS ==
• Reinforce monthly billing value: manageable installments, pest-free guarantee, re-services included  
• Confirm billing frequency before quoting or rescheduling  
• Never promise Paid in Full discount manually  
• Document all adjustments in PestRoutes with approver noted  
• Escalate accidental charges if disputed or unclear

== EDGE CASES ==
• Legacy accounts may have nonstandard billing logic or fields  
• Blank frequency or symbols (e.g. “£”) → escalate to Scheduling  
• Frequency field may influence technician dispatch—ensure accuracy
