      <h2>What is Considered a Code Red?</h2>
      <h3>Customer Threatens to:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Post negatively on BBB</li>
            <li>Post on social media outlets / online in any way</li>
            <li>News Outlet</li>
            <li>Threatening Attorney General (AG)</li>
            <li>Has legal partner or is working with one</li>
            <li>Home Damage 5,000+ / Made Pet Sick</li>
            <li>Threatening or has taken any type of legal action</li>
            <li>Customer has persisting pest Issues / Infestations</li>
            <li>Someone accuses employee of any crimes</li>
            <li>General escalations that are unresolved / expressed severe dissatisfaction</li>
          </ul>
      <h2>1. Acknowledge, Align, Assure:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Acknowledge the customer's concern by restating the issue specifically.</li>
        <li>Align with their feelings by expressing empathy.</li>
        <li>Assure them that you will work towards a resolution - focus on what you can do to help.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Submit a Code Red Form:</h2>
      <p>Include customer name and account number, brief summary of situation, de-escalation methods used, interaction end result.</p>

      <h2>3. Avoid Admitting Guilt By:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="color: red;">Asking Open-Ended Questions:</span> Do not assume a situation one way or the other in your question. For example, do not say: "When did the agent yell at you?" Instead, say: "When did this happen?"</li>
        <li><span style="color: red;">Empathize Without Admitting Guilt</span>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Complaint:</strong> "Your service is terrible! The agent was so rude to me."</li>
            <li><strong>Bad Response:</strong> "I'm sorry our agent was rude to you. We shouldn't have treated you that way."</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral Response:</strong> "I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Can you tell me more about what happened?" This response acknowledges the customer's frustration without admitting fault and invites the customer to provide more details.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Escalation:</h2>
      <p>Depending on the situation, you will either take the call yourself or escalate the call to the escalations queue. See below to know what to do for which.</p>
