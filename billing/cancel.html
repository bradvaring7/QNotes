    <h2>1st - Empathize</h2>
    <p><b>When a customer wants to cancel, it’s crucial to first empathize with their situation. Use phrases that
      acknowledge their feelings and concerns. Here are some examples:</b></p>
    <p><b>Still Seeing Pests: </b><i>"I understand why you're looking to make changes. I would feel the same way if If I were paying for something
        that I didn't feel was working. I'm sorry if you haven't seen results from our services yet and will do
        everything I can on all this call to make it right for!"</i></p>
    <p><b>Pricing Concerns: </b><i>"I appreciate you for sharing your price concerns with me. It seems like everything just keeps getting more
        and more expensive these days. The last thing we want is to be a financial burden for you!"</i></p>
    <p><b>Scheduling Issue: </b><i>"I can see why you want to make these changes. Sounds like you are just wanting to get your house
        taken care of, and I'm sorry if there have been conflicts that have got in the way of that."</i></p>
    <p><b>Pro/Employee Experience: </b><i>"Thank you for reaching out and sharing what happened. I'm documenting everything to ensure the right people
        are in the loop so we can look into this further. I'm so sorry for the experience you had, and I completely
        understand why you want to explore other options moving forward."</i></p>
