            <p class="category-line">
                <a href="index.html">BILLING</a> > Disputes/Refunds
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-content">
            <p>This page provides an overview of what a dispute to a charge is, how disputes are handled, and specific policies regarding the sensitivity towards refunds when a customer has a dispute.</p>

            <h2>üí∏ What is a Dispute?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever seen a charge in your bank account, that you didn't understand or agree with?</p>
            <p>A dispute is when a customer questions a charge on their credit card due to various reasons. This may include, but is not limited to billing errors, unauthorized transactions, or issues with goods or services. To start a dispute, the customer contacts their bank or credit card issuer. The bank or card issuer will send the dispute to Greenix to gather information about the transaction.</p>

            <h2>‚úÖ Good Safeguards for Disputes</h2>
            
            <div class="note-box">
                <p><strong>Important Rule:</strong> All CX should <strong>NOT</strong> submit a refund on disputed invoices.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>When we could submit a refund while in dispute would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code Reds</strong></li>
                <li>To <strong>save an account in Loyalty</strong> with approval from a supervisor</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Policy Exists</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If we submit a refund during an active dispute, there could be complications while the dispute is in progress</li>
                <li>Could result in losing the dispute, later resulting in the customer receiving two credits on their statement</li>
                <li>Fees are involved with losing a dispute, which increases the cost to Greenix</li>
                <li>If the dispute is already won, then refunding that invoice requires us to send a check</li>
                <li>Leaves us open to lose a secondary dispute (called arbitration) which comes with higher fees</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üîç Signs an Invoice is Being Disputed</h2>
            
            <h3>Notes from Accounting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look for "Dispute" or "Chargeback" in the note section by Accounting</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unsuccessful Chargeback Coupons</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You may see Unsuccessful Chargeback Coupons on invoices</li>
                <li>This means Greenix won the dispute but there is still a chance the customer can fight this</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Active Dispute Flag</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Active Dispute flag will appear on the Account</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚ùì Preferred Options Other Than Refunding Disputed Invoice</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Coupon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Add a coupon to the account for the same amount</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Code Reds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If a Code Red situation, and the refund for that invoice is preferred, we can refund it once the dispute is resolved</li>
                <li>Only through a check and only if we win the dispute</li>
                <li>If we lose the dispute, the customer will get the money back anyway</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Submit a Ticket</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For all situations where a customer requests a refund for a disputed invoice, submit a ticket to the accounting team as <strong>"General Questions"</strong></li>
                <li>This alerts them to the situation</li>
                <li>Also add proper notes to the account</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Agent Reminders</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Never refund disputed invoices without supervisor approval</li>
                <li>Check for dispute flags and accounting notes before processing refunds</li>
                <li>Use coupons as alternative to refunds when appropriate</li>
                <li>Always submit tickets to accounting for disputed refund requests</li>
                <li>Document all actions and conversations in account notes</li>
                <li>Code Red situations may be exceptions - get supervisor approval</li>
            </ul>
